# Comprehensive Installation

## A comprehensive approach: the GDS Docker container (slightly more advanced and complicated installation)

If you meet the following requirements, Docker is a stable alternative and works out of the box:

- You have admin rights over your machine
- You are running either Windows 10 Pro, macOS, or Linux distributions that are supported by Docker.

It provides a stable platform to run complex software setups like that required in this context. Docker is a containerization technology that allows you to run pre-packaged (containerized) software under controlled environments. Relying on Docker, the `gds_env` project provides a containerized platform for Geographic/Urban Data Science.
