# To Begin With

I want to start this course by acknowledging the turmoil and uncertainty of current events globally. Even though life in the Netherlands might appear stable, many of us have firsthand experiences of upheavals due to the ongoing pandemic, wars, energy crises, or other issues. If you're going through difficult times, **you're not alone**. Should you choose to share your struggles with me, know that your information will be confidential, and you will not be judged. I will do my best to listen and find the support you need. I also hope for your understanding and feedback to improve any shortcomings in the course.

## How to Be Okay?

My primary goal is to support your learning while taking your health and well-being into account. This way, you can complete the course regardless of any challenges you might be facing. Here are some ground rules:

- **You don't owe me 'productivity' or 'efficiency'**: I'm interested in your attention, so we all can learn.
- **Personal Information**: You're not obliged to disclose any details about your personal, mental, or physical health.
- **Open Channel**: If you're open to it, feel free to discuss any issues you're going through. Just drop me an email, and we can sort things out.
- **Accommodations**: If you need extra assistance, have to miss class, or require more time for assignments, don't hesitate to ask. Both the TAs and I are here to work with you.
