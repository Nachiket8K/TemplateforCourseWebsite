## Course Language
English & Python

### Why Python
- General-purpose programming language
- "Sweet spot" between "proof-of-concept" and "production-ready"
- Industry standard: GIS (Esri, QGIS) and Data Science (World Bank, OECD, The Atlantic, Gemeente Den Haag…)

## Expected Prior Knowledge
Students should have some prior programming experience. It will be beneficial if you have dealt with a functional programming language like R or Python before. If you have never programmed before, it is recommended to do a crash course in Python through Coursera or other online services before joining the class.

## Other Information
- Graduate students from all faculties and exchange universities are welcome.
- Courses are also available in other faculties more tailored to your respective programs.
- This course will add to your skills and provide tools for future roles in policy-making, data science, and open science.

## Philosophy of the Course
- Methods and techniques
- General overview
- Intuition
- Very little math
- Emphasis on application and real-world use

## Feedback Strategy
- **Formative Feedback**: Weekly general feedback on labs by TAs and direct interaction in lectures, labs, and discussions.
- **Summative Feedback**: Graded assessment of assignments and a final project. Feedback provided before the next assignment is due.
- **Peer Support**: Online forum maintained by the instructor for Q&A.

## Questions
This course focuses on learning to learn. For questions, follow the efficient and organized way of learning outlined in the course.
