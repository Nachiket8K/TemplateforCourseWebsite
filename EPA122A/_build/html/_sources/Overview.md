# Overview

## What is Urban Data Science?

### Urbanisation

Historically, humans have always been drawn to dense spatial agglomerations for social interactions, the exchange of goods, services, and ideas. Cities are projected to be home to over 80% of the world population by 2050, and this rapid urbanization presents numerous challenges ranging from poverty and segregation to environmental degradation. In some exceptional cases, cities like Jakarta are even contemplating relocating due to rising sea levels.

### Urban Data

Advancements in technology have paved the way for the integration of networked systems, sensors, and computers into the urban landscape. This 'smart' infrastructure provides a constant, real-time stream of data, which has the potential to significantly impact the management and development of cities. However, this data revolution has both positive and negative effects on communities, often exacerbating existing inequalities.

## Course Contents

The primary goal of this course is to educate future data scientists about the ethical and social implications of data-driven decision-making, particularly in the context of urban development. The course will equip students with the skills to:

1. **Obtain**: Gather data from various open data sources.
2. **Scrub**: Clean, munge, and sample data to create an informative and manageable dataset.
3. **Explore**: Conduct exploratory data analysis.
4. **Model**: Use statistical tools like regression and clustering for modeling.
5. **Interpret**: Communicate results through visualization, storytelling, and summary reports.

## Pedagogical Goals

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Interpret and discuss relevant data sources for presented problems.
- Manipulate data to create informative and manageable datasets.
- Analyze datasets to substantiate your problems with evidence.
- Apply statistical and machine learning models to infer results.
- Communicate your findings effectively through various mediums.

And hopefully, you'll be well-equipped for a future job in data-driven policy or other ventures that require a nuanced understanding of data's role in society.
